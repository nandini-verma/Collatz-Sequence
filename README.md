# Collatz-Sequence-
Collatz sequence is an unsolved problem in mathematics.
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. The Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values
